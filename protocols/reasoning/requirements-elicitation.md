# Protocol: Requirements Elicitation

Apply this protocol when converting a natural language description of a feature,
system, or project into structured requirements. The goal is to produce
requirements that are **precise, testable, unambiguous, and traceable**.

## Phase 1: Scope Extraction

From the provided description:

1. Identify the **core objective**: what problem does this solve? For whom?
2. Identify **explicit constraints**: performance targets, compatibility
   requirements, regulatory requirements, deadlines.
3. Identify **implicit constraints**: assumptions about the environment,
   platform, or existing system that are not stated but required.
   Flag each with `[IMPLICIT]`.
4. Define **what is in scope** and **what is out of scope**. When the
   boundary is unclear, enumerate the ambiguity and ask for clarification.

## Phase 2: Requirement Decomposition

For each capability described:

1. Break it into **atomic requirements** — each requirement describes
   exactly one testable behavior or constraint.
2. Use **RFC 2119 keywords** precisely:
   - MUST / MUST NOT — absolute requirement or prohibition
   - SHALL / SHALL NOT — equivalent to MUST (used in some standards)
   - SHOULD / SHOULD NOT — recommended but not absolute
   - MAY — truly optional
3. Assign a **stable identifier**: `REQ-<CATEGORY>-<NNN>`
   - Category is a short domain tag (e.g., AUTH, PERF, DATA, UI)
   - Number is sequential within the category
4. Write each requirement in the form:
   ```
   REQ-<CAT>-<NNN>: The system MUST/SHALL/SHOULD/MAY <behavior>
   when <condition> so that <rationale>.
   ```

## Phase 3: Ambiguity Detection

Review each requirement for:

1. **Vague adjectives**: "fast," "responsive," "secure," "scalable,"
   "user-friendly" — replace with measurable criteria.
2. **Unquantified quantities**: "handle many users," "large files" —
   replace with specific numbers or ranges.
3. **Implicit behavior**: "the system handles errors" — what errors?
   What does "handle" mean? Retry? Log? Alert? Fail open? Fail closed?
4. **Undefined terms**: if a term could mean different things to different
   readers, add it to a glossary with a precise definition.
5. **Missing negative requirements**: for every "the system MUST do X,"
   consider "the system MUST NOT do Y" (e.g., "MUST NOT expose PII in logs").

## Phase 4: Dependency and Conflict Analysis

1. Identify **dependencies** between requirements: which requirements
   must be satisfied before others can be implemented or tested?
2. Check for **conflicts**: requirements that contradict each other
   or create impossible constraints.
3. Check for **completeness**: are there scenarios or edge cases
   that no requirement covers? If so, draft candidate requirements
   and flag them as `[CANDIDATE]` for review.

## Phase 5: Acceptance Criteria

For each requirement:

1. Define at least one **acceptance criterion** — a concrete test that
   determines whether the requirement is met.
2. Acceptance criteria should be:
   - **Specific**: describes exact inputs, actions, and expected outputs.
   - **Measurable**: pass/fail is objective, not subjective.
   - **Independent**: testable without requiring other requirements to be met
     (where possible).
